## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrew, I am Linux admin and software developer.   
I'm open for freelance work as sysadmin or developer.

### What can I do?
You can see most of my code in my [github](https://github.com/aceberg) repo.

- `Golang` app with `HTML/JS` web GUI: small, lightweight, self-hosted. Can be easily integrated with almost anything.
- `Flutter` multiplatform app (`Android` and `Linux`, mostly).
- `Bash` script, `Dockerfile` or `Ansible` playbook.

All prices can be negotiated. Please, contact me aceberg_a@proton.me
