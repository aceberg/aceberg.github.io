## About me
I have been working with Open Source software for years, both professionally and personally. While configuring and using existing software is valuable, I discovered my true passion when I started building my own. From that moment on, I knew there was no turning back - I enjoy creating applications tailored to specific needs, whether for work or personal projects.

Now, I’m looking for a role as a Frontend Developer (React) or Backend Developer (Go). I’m equally comfortable in both areas and eager to contribute to meaningful projects.
