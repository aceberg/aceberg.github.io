*Frontend Developer (React)/Backend Developer (Go)/Linux Sysadmin*

## About me
I have been working with Open Source software for years, both professionally and personally. While configuring and using existing software is valuable, I discovered my true passion when I started building my own. From that moment on, I knew there was no turning back—I enjoy creating applications tailored to specific needs, whether for work or personal projects.

Now, I’m looking for a role as a Frontend Developer (React) or Backend Developer (Go). I’m equally comfortable in both areas and eager to contribute to meaningful projects.

## Skills
#### Backend
- Go (gin), API - example: [WatchYourLAN](https://github.com/aceberg/WatchYourLAN)
- Go (telegram-bot-api) - example: [LinuxExecBot](https://github.com/aceberg/LinuxExecBot)

#### Frontend
- TypeScript, React (MobX) - example: [AnyAppStart](https://github.com/aceberg/AnyAppStart)
- SolidJS - example: [DiaryMD](https://github.com/aceberg/DiaryMD)
- JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap - example: [ExerciseDiary](https://github.com/aceberg/ExerciseDiary)
