[BookTr](https://github.com/aceberg/BookTr) is a tool for reading texts in foreign languages. Features:
- Uses [LibreTranslate API](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate), but other APIs can be added later
- **Side-by-side** translation, **aligned paragraphs**
- Can **save** translations in `json` format
- **Select** word to see its translation, **double click** to translate every word in a sentence
- Fully **Self-Hosted**, can work **offline**

## Reasons for creating BookTr
The best way to learn a foreign language for me is by reading books in it. I tried doing it with Google Translate and other similar online tools, it's been frustrating: the interface is not suitable for long texts.

So, I decided to create my own)).

I am open to suggestions about adding other translation APIs, the only limit is - no paid ones. Only free online or self-hosted.

## Quick start (Docker)

First, run **LibreTranslate** container. It will take some time (~20 minutes) and resources (~1Gb memory, 10+Gb disk). When you see it's web interface at port 5000, move on to installing **BookTr**.

```sh
docker run --name ltr \
    -p 5000:5000 \
  libretranslate/libretranslate
```

```sh
docker run --name BookTr \
    -e "TZ=$YOURTIMEZONE" \                  # your TZ here
    -e "LTRPATH=http://$YOURADDRESS:5000" \  # LibreTranslate URL
    -v ~/.dockerdata/BookTr:/data/BookTr  \ 
    -p 8856:8856 \
  aceberg/BookTr
``` 
Or use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/aceberg/BookTr/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
