I've created several Open Source self-hosted apps and including Auth option in every one of them makes them unnecessary overcomplicated. Also, harder to release updates.

So, I decided to make a separate Auth app [ForAuth](https://github.com/aceberg/ForAuth). For now, it is simple session-cookie auth for single user, but I have plans to enhance it.

### Example 1:
In case of usual apps like [WatchYourPorts](https://github.com/aceberg/WatchYourPorts) it is enough to protect the app from unauthorized access:   
[docker-compose-auth.yml](https://github.com/aceberg/WatchYourPorts/blob/main/docker-compose-auth.yml)

### Example 2:
[WatchYourLAN](https://github.com/aceberg/WatchYourLAN) is a bit more complicated. It needs `host` network mode to work. So, WYL port will be exposed in this setup and needs to be protected with firewall.   
[docker-compose-auth.yml](https://github.com/aceberg/WatchYourLAN/blob/main/docker-compose-auth.yml)

### P.S.
Of course, I'm aware of SSO tools like Authelia and Authentik. They should work fine with my apps. [ForAuth](https://github.com/aceberg/ForAuth) is just much simpler to configure and maintain.
