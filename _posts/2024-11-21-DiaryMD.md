Markdown diary written in `Go` and `SolidJS`:
- Fully configurable Themes
- Tabs
- WorkSpaces
- Simple Blog
- Full screen mode
- Works with a given directory (could be a `git` repo). No DB needed

## Reasons for creating DiaryMD
I've got a lot of different types of texts I want to manage in a single app and store in different `git` repos (IT docs, Food recipes, Personal blog and even Fanfiction :grin: ). I tried to use IDE, but something like VSCode was definitely overkill. Also, I wanted an option to navigate through old texts in a blog format.

That's why I created DiaryMD. It has unlimited WorkSpaces, each WorkSpace with it's own theme, repo and blog (optional). It supports Markdown formatting with [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) editor, but can be used with any kind of text files.
